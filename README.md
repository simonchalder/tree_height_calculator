Usage:

- Measure the distance from the base of the tree and enter
- Measure the angle from the observer's eye to the base of the tree and enter. If the observer's eye is higher than the tree base, enter the angle as a negative number
- Measure the angle from the observer's eye to the top of the tree and enter
- Press the calculate button to see the tree's height to 2 decimal places

To-do:

- UI improvements
- Functionality for calculating tree diameter, volume and weight
- Anything else which may be useful during tree surveys / inspections
